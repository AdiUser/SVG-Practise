Making friends with SVG.js and paper.js 

`<self_note>` 

Lately I have been noticing a decrease in my personal growth, and it feels something, rather exactly like :point_right: :poop:.
So to make me :smiley: again, I decided to learn these two libraries.

  `<side_note>`

   *I know that these two libraries are huge and it is not at all possible for me to learn everything immediately. 
   So, I'll just focus on quick 'take-aways' i.e things that I think I might use in near future.*

  `</side_note>` 

**PS:** No promises tho, but I'll try to write what I learn. 

Game ON :exclamation:

## SVG.js

### What is SVG?

SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics are things that make "somethings" easy and wonderful.
As the name suggests, they (automatically scale)<sup>[1]</sup> themseleves a/c to the viewport.
The graphics are generated by XML tags that are wrapped with a `<svg>` tag. Normally, defining these tags is tedious, and that's why libraries like SVG.js are fun. They make things less complicated and make your source look handsome-er. 
SVGs are used world wide for making :ok_hand: and :muscle: UI designs.

### Initiating SVG.js

Creating an instance of SVG.js is easy. You just need a div element with an `id` attr.
Create an SVG instance by, 

`var svg = SVG('id');`

This will make `svg` an SVG object with which you can draw and manipulate shapes, text and much more.

### Creating a Polygon

Polygons look good. Websites often have slanting/sloped designs that look fabulous. There are various techniques used for brewing those sloppy designs and SVGs happen to be one of them. SVG.js provides a handy method `SVG.polygon()` for creating such polygons.

`var polygon = svg.polygon([[top right][bottom right][][]..])`

Tne `polygon()` method takes array of x,y coordinates in anti-clockwise fashion.
You can also pass points in a comma (`,`) seperated string format if you like.
eg :- `"14,32,35,76,34,42,75,21..."`

SVG.js also provides utility methods like `fill(color)`, `stroke(type)`, `animate(time)` that can be used to make your SVGs look more attractive and interactive.

### SVG Texts

SVG texts are not as flexible as they are in normal HTML. SVG can not automate text flowing due to its basic working structure hence, new lines are needed to be provided explicitly. Each line is wrapped within `<tspan>` tags which are used for formating the text. SVG.js provides methods by which you can format text just like you do for HTML text. Below are some ways in which you can create text nodes. 

```javascript
	
	var textX = svg.text("hello text");
	var textY = svg.text(function(add) {
			add.tspan("SVG text").newLine()
				.tspan("with a new line defined explicitly.");
		})
	var textZ = svg.text("New lines can also be defined by \n");
	var textX1 = svg.plain("Simple text with no new lines.");

		text.font({
		  family:   'Helvetica'
		, size:     144
		, anchor:   'middle'
		, leading:  '1.5em'
		});
```	

Available properties for `font()` are:

*leading (will do the same as calling the leading() method as setter)
 *leading == line height
*anchor (will set the text-anchor attribute)
*family (will set the font-family attribute)
*size (will set the font-size attribute)
*stretch (will set the font-stretch attribute)
*style (will set the font-style attribute)
*variant (will set the font-variant attribute)
*weight (will set the font-weight attribute)
