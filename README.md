Making friends with SVG.js and paper.js 

`<self_note>` 

Lately I have been noticing a decrease in my personal growth, and it feels something, rather exactly like :point_right: :poop:.
So to make me :smiley: again, I decided to learn these two libraries. 

**PS:** No promises tho, but I'll try to write what I learn. 

Game ON :exclamation:

###What is SVG?

SVG or Scalable Vector Graphics are things that make "somethings" easy and wonderful.
As the name suggests, they (automatically scale)<sup>[1]</sup> themseleves a/c to the viewport.
The graphics are generated by XML tags that are wrapped with a `<svg>` tag. Normally, defining these tags is tedious, and that's why libraries like SVG.js are fun. They make things less complicated and make your source look handsome-er. 
SVGs are used world wide for making :ok_hand: and :muscle: UI designs.
